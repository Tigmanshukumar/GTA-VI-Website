        <p>
          Jason and Lucia have always known the deck is stacked against them.
          But when an easy score goes wrong, they find themselves on the darkest
          side of the sunniest place in America, in the middle of a criminal
          conspiracy stretching across the state of Leonida — forced to rely on
          each other more than ever if they want to make it out alive.

          <p class="character-description">
            Jason grew up around grifters and crooks. After a stint in the Army trying to shake off his troubled teens, 
            he found himself in the Keys doing what he knows best, working for local drug runners. It might be time to try something new.

          <p class="character-description">
            Meeting Lucia could be the best or worst thing to ever happen to him. 
            Jason knows how he'd like it to turn out but right now, it's hard to tell.

          <p class="character-description">
            Life has been coming at her swinging ever since. Fighting for her family landed her in the Leonida Penitentiary. 
            Sheer luck got her out. Lucia's learned her lesson — only smart moves from here.

          <p class="character-quote">"The only thing that matters is who you know and what you got."</p>
          <p class="character-description">
            Fresh out of prison and ready to change the odds in her favor, Lucia's committed to her plan — no matter what it takes.
            A life with Jason could be her way out.
